# Wisdom Party 
The Wisdom Party is motivated by the call for constitutional governance and adherence to certain principles described on the main page. The Wisdom Party is created for the middle half of the country which is neither staunchly Democrat nor staunchly Republican, but instead wishes to see the government do what is right, wise, and just.
