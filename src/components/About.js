        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <br></br>
        <details>
        <summary>1. Limited Powers Principle</summary>
            <p>That the federal government is one of limited powers, derived solely from the constitution, and the grants of power shown therein, ought to be strictly construed by all the departments and agents of the government, and that it is inexpedient and dangerous to exercise doubtful constitutional powers.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>2. Restraint Principle</summary>
            <p>That the constitution does not confer upon the general government the power to commence and carry on, a general system of internal improvements.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>3. Non-Assumption of Debts Principle</summary>
            <p>That the constitution does not confer authority upon the federal government, directly or indirectly, to assume the debts of the several states, contracted for local internal improvements, or other state purposes; nor would such assumption be just or expedient.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>4. Protection of Competition Principle</summary>
            <p>That justice and sound policy forbid the federal government to foster one branch of industry to the detriment of another, or to cherish the interests of one portion to the injury of another portion of our common country—that every citizen and every section of the country, has a right to demand and insist upon an equality of rights and privileges, and to complete and ample protection of person and property from domestic violence, or foreign aggression.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>5. Rigid Economy Principle</summary>
            <p>That it is the duty of every branch of the government, to enforce and practice the most rigid economy, in conducting our public affairs, and that no more revenue ought to be raised, than is required to defray the necessary expenses of the government.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>6. Non-Central Bank Principle</summary>
            <p>That congress has no power to charter a national bank; that we believe such an institution one of deadly hostility to the best interests of the country, dangerous to our republican institutions and the liberties of the people, and calculated to place the business of the country within the control of a concentrated money power, and above the laws and the will of the people.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>7. Separation Of Government And Banks Principle</summary>
            <p>That the separation of the moneys of the government from banking institutions, is indispensable for the safety of the funds of the government, and the rights of the people.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>8. Thomas Jefferson Principle</summary>
            <p>That the liberal principles embodied by Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence, and sanctioned in the constitution, which makes ours the land of liberty, and the asylum of the oppressed of every nation, have ever been cardinal principles in the democratic faith; and every attempt to abridge the present privilege of becoming citizens, and the owners of soil among us, ought to be resisted with the same spirit which swept the alien and sedition laws from our statute-book.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>9. Voter ID Principle</summary>
            <p>You have to show an ID to buy beer, therefore, you have to show an ID to vote.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>10. Deliberate Defense Principle</summary>
            <p> 48 out of 50 state legislatures must ratify any initiation of a military operation or declaration of war.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>11. Fight Smart, Obvious, and Winnable Wars Principle</summary>
            <p>Only fight in wars which are smart, and winnable. Do not initiate military action in the pursuit of amorphous ends, such as patrol or the training of a police force in a foreign country. The United States Defense Department must only be tasked with fighting winnable wars with clear, obvious, tangible end outcomes.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>12. States As Laboratories For Policy Principle</summary>
            <p>Act locally, wonder universally. Examine policies by asking, "Does this policy scale?" It is okay if the answer is no. If the answer is yes, can you extract and release a blueprint for others to replicate your successes? <em>"It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country."</em> - Justice Louis Brandeis, <em>New State Ice Co. v. Liebermann</em>, (1932).</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>13. Accountability Principle</summary>
            <p>States have to create agencies for prosecuting crimes committed by federal agents which violate the rights of individuals.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>14. Remove The Federal Income Tax Principle</summary>
            <p>The Federal Income Tax is immoral. The federal government must not be complicit in unethical practices against the very free people which endow the government with the sacred responsibility of serving as their agent.</p>
            <p>The Federal Income Tax is not grounded in moral thinking. If you wake up at the crack of dawn to improve at your craft and enhance your work, you are not inherently incurring an obligation to pay the federal government anything. Diligence is something praiseworthy. Diligence is not something, which, like alcohol or certain substance use, must be subject to a tax which is intended to have the effect of <em>reducing</em> the activity at hand.</p> 
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>15. Abolition of the Federal Reserve Principle</summary>
            <p>The Federal Reserve has facilitated a pathway by which the United States has accrued $31 trillion worth of debt. "I sincerely believe with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; & that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale," Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1816. A central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, is unconstitutional, according to Jefferson. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 instituted today's central bank, however, the existence of a central bank remains unconstitutional.</p>
            <p>"Thomas Jefferson was afraid that a national bank would create a financial monopoly that might undermine state banks and adopt policies that favored financiers and merchants, who tended to be creditors, over plantation owners and family farmers, who tended to be debtors," according to Andrew T. Hill, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. <a href='https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/first-bank-of-the-us' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer'>Report</a>.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve's role as a provider of payment rails for the facilitation of commerce between states must be handled by state banks, such as the bank of Illinois, the bank of North Carolina, the bank of Texas, the bank of Florida, and so on.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>16. Abolition to the Department of Homeland Security Principle</summary>
            <p>The Department of Defense secures America's borders. Americans live in safety and freedom because of the Department of Defense. The Department of Homeland Security is superflous.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>17. Pareto Principle</summary>
            <p>Apply the Pareto Principle to essential government services. 20% of the workers are producing 80% of the value of the government services. Eliminate the non-productive laborers employed by the government by cutting 80% of staff.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>18. Abolition of Forced Labor Principle</summary>
            <p>Forced labor was wrong during the period of America's history when slavery was a common practice in certain areas. Over time, we recognized forced labor is morally heinous and therefore illegal. We abhor forced labor in its present form of the Federal Income Tax.</p>
            <p>Suppose the federal income tax is 20%. The meaning of the 20% income tax is that one in five hours of productive work is for the government. Another valid conception of how forced labor has made a way into the present is to consider the calendar year. With a 20% income tax, the first 2.4 months of the year result in you making income which solely goes to the government. With a 20% federal income tax, you may only keep 9.6 months of earnings in return for working 12 months. Forced labor in its present form must be abolished. </p>

        <details>
            <summary>19. Speak Softly and Own The Most Bombs Principle</summary>
            <p>The analysis of American national security is obviated by the ability to rapidly and deliberately overpower an adversary. We own the domain of military supremeacy by virtue of owning the most bombs and owning the most effective delivery platforms.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>20. Positive Return on Investment Principle</summary>
            <p>Policy is associated with a fantastic, positive return on investment. Every dollar allocated by Congress is the property of the American taxpayer. Dollars allocated to NATO via DoD allocation, to Israel, and to Ukraine must be associated with a positive return on investment.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>21. Optimize Foreign Entanglements Principle</summary>
            <p>George Washington insisted upon avoiding foreign entanglements. As the world superpower America is uniquely positioned to be involved in countries spanning the globe. We must harmonize relations with foreign nations through optimization.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>22. Look Out For Those Neighbors Who Had Our Backs Principle</summary>
            <p>We look out for those neighbors who had our backs during the war for independence: France and Poland.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>23. Honor the Spirit of '76 Principle</summary>
            <p>The principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence promised to lead America—and other nations on the globe—into a new era of freedom.  The revolution begun by Americans on July 4, 1776 would never end.  It would inspire all peoples living under the burden of oppression and ignorance to open their eyes to the rights of mankind, to overturn the power of tyrants, and to declare the triumph of equality over inequality.
Thomas Jefferson recognized as much, preparing a letter for the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration less than two weeks before his death, he expressed his belief that the Declaration, "be to the world what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all.) the Signal of arousing men to burst the chains, under which Monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings & security of self government. the form which we have substituted restores the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. all eyes are opened, or opening to the rights of man. the general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth that the mass of mankind has not been born, with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of god. these are grounds of hope for others. for ourselves let the annual return of this day, for ever refresh our recollections of these rights and an undiminished devotion to them." Thomas Jefferson shared these remarks in a letter to Roger Chew Weightman in 1826. </p>

            <summary>24. Honor the Revolution of 1800 Principle</summary>
            <p>
                "I had read in the Enquirer, and with great approbation the pieces signed Hampden, and have read them again with redoubled approbation in the copies you have been so kind as to send me. I subscribe to every tittle of them. they contain the true principles of the revolution of 1800. for that was as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 76. was in it’s form; not effected indeed by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people. the nation declared it’s will by dismissing functionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election," Thomas Jefferson said to Spencer Roane in a letter from 1819.

        <details>
            <summary>25. Intergenerational Harmony Principle</summary>
            <p>One generation must not place undue burdens on subsequent generations. The financial position of the country must be advanced and preserved. The environment must be safeguarded.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>26. Government Accountability Principle</summary>
            <p>Stand with those who identify corruption and fraud.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>27. Honesty Before Congress Principle</summary>
            <p>Prosecute dishonesty, also known as perjury, committed before the Senate and the House of Representative. The legislature is the instrument and agent of the people's will. The conditions for truthful communications in the environment where the people's will is embodied must be preserved.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>28. Prohibition of Domestic Surveillance</summary>
            <p>"What more is neccessary to make us a happy and prosperous people? Still one thing more, fellow-citizens -- a wise and frugal Government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned," Thomas Jefferson wrote in the First Inaugural Address.</p>
            <p>"I know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a republican government can not be strong, that this Government is not strong enough; but would the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment, abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this Government, the world's best hope, may by possibility want energy to preserve itself? I trust not. I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest Government on earth. I believe it the only one where every man, at the call of the law, would fly to the standard of the law, and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern. Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question," Thomas Jefferson wrote in the First Inaugural Address.
